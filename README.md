## Arca ##

Hi. I'm a starter theme called Arca. I'm a theme based on _s, i meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

**Built In Feature**

 - `get_the_image();` ( libs/extends/get-the-image.php ) plugin by justin tadlock, this function will make it easier to grab an image from custom fields, post attachment, etc. [Docs](https://github.com/justintadlock/get-the-image)
 - `placeholder();` ( libs/inc/theme-functions.php:22 ) a simple function to generate placeholder image based on [placehold.it](http://placehold.it)
 - `limit();` ( libs/inc/theme-functions.php:99 ) limit string
 - `wp_pagination();` ( libs/inc/theme-functions.php:115 ) add numeric pagination to wordpress looping
